# About Me

<div style="float: left; width: 70%">

I'm a junior at IIIT-H, pursuing a BTech in Computer Science, and, an MS by Research in Computational Natural Sciences.<br/>

I'm very passionate about understanding the brain, and how that works, which led me to the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, And from that, I have become deeply interested in multi modal systems, and Systems Biology, which I have chosen as my field of research for my MS thesis, and I'm currently working under Prof. Bhaswar Ghosh, in the Computational Biology Lab @ IIIT-H. 

On a completely different note, I'm also a firm believer in Privacy being a human right, and that has led me to Blockchain technology. I'm currently involved in multiple projects in the Cosmos/Tendermint ecosystem.
